PIPENV VS ENV

# Don't feel obligated to use pipenv. It is generally recommended to help people who are intimidated by virtualenvs, and is not appropriate for all use cases. It actually relies on pip and virtualenv, so virtualenv is not going away. There are also some common criticisms of pipenv. See this blog post for some examples.

# virtualenv (venv), on the other hand, is bundled with python itself, so is certainly more stable, widespread and canonically correct. So you won't run into problems like this.

USING A VENV

# python -m venv myvenv

# myvenv\Scripts\activate

# pip install --upgrade pip

# python -m pip install django~=1.11.0 - LTS-2017

# Remember to run everything in the virtualenv. If you don't see a prefix (myvenv) in your

# console, you need to activate your virtualenv. We explained how to do that in the Django

# installation chapter in the Working with virtualenv part. Typing myvenv\Scripts\activate

# on Windows or source myvenv/bin/activate on Mac OS X or Linux will do this for you.

# django-admin.exe startproject mysite .

# manage.py is a script that helps with management of the site. With it we will be able (amongst other things) to start a web server on our computer without installing anything else.

# The settings.py file contains the configuration of your website. Remember when we talked about a mail carrier checking where to deliver a letter? urls.py file contains a list of patterns used by urlresolver .

## CREATE DB:

To create a database for our blog, let's run the following in the console: python manage.py
migrate (we need to be in the djangogirls directory that contains the manage.py file).

## Starting the web server
